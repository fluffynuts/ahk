; When this worked, it was good; but I found that sometimes it would just stop
;   working -- and really, the only thing I want is for win-tab to work like 
;   alt-tab and remap the RHS command / option keys (which I can do with SharpKeys)
;   -> keeping this around for reference more than anything else
RAlt::Ins ; right-Option to Insert
RWin::Del ; right command to forward delete
LWin::LAlt ; left command to alt
LAlt::LWin ; left alt to command (windows key)
CapsLock::Escape
F1::Pause
Ctrl & F1::CtrlBreak
